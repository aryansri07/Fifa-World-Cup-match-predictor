# Fifa-World-Cup-match-predictor

The aim of this project is to predict match outcomes of World Cup football matches more accurately than bookkeepers. Based on the dataset provided on kaggle that includes world cup match data, which consisted of home team, away team, stage of the tournament,etc. I built a model to predict the match outcome â€“ win, draw, or defeat.

I also compared various multiple classification algorithms and choose the one that performed the best on a separate test dataset and tuned the hyperparemeters of the alogirthm on a seperate cross validation set using Gridsearchcv. The best score came around 53% accuracy which is pretty satisfactory considering the randomness  of a football match.
